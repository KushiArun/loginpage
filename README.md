The Login Page is a fundamental component of user authentication for web applications. This project focuses on creating a secure and user-friendly interface for users to access their accounts. It serves as the entry point to a system or platform, ensuring that only authorized individuals can access personalized information or services.

Key features of the login page include:

Username and Password Fields: Allows users to input their credentials for secure authentication.
Validation: Includes client-side and/or server-side validation to ensure that the entered information is correct and meets required formats (e.g., valid email address or password strength).
Error Handling: Displays appropriate error messages for incorrect credentials or invalid inputs.
